**Advanced Data Visualisation - Namma Yatri Analysis**
Case study on Namma Yatri App by Naveen, Sai Laxmi and Mohit.

**Introduction:**
-> The Namma Yatri app, developed by Bengaluru’s Auto Rickshaw Drivers’ Union (ARDU) and built by Juspay Technologies with support from the Beckn Foundation (founded by   Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani), was launched in November 2022 in collaboration with local auto drivers.
-> It’s Direct-to-Driver open mobility platform.
-> App has become Bengaluru's most loved auto app, since its formal launch in January 2023.

**Purpose and Goals**
**Project Overview:**
-> Review of data analysis findings to inform technical development.
-> Focus on system optimization, feature enhancement, and performance.
-> Translating insights into actionable development tasks. 

**Key Objective:** Understand user behavior, ride performance, and revenue drivers
**Outcome:** Actionable insights and technical suggestions.

**Data Integration and Structure**
-> Overview of the data sources and tables (Assembly, Duration, Payment, Trip Details, Trips)
-> Explanation of the data joins and relationships
-> Discussion of data types and potential normalization/optimization.

**Handling Peak Hours**
-> Highlighting peak demand periods (8-10 AM, 5-8 PM).   
-> Implications for server load, database performance, and scalability.   
-> Strategies for load balancing, caching, and queue management.

**Revenue-Related Data Points**
-> Analysis of fare data and its relation to trip duration and time of day.   
-> Considerations for dynamic pricing algorithms or surge pricing features
-> Secure and efficient handling of payment data
-> Technical Considerations
-> Implementation of fare calculation logic.
-> Integration with payment gateways.
-> Data security and compliance (e.g., PCI DSS).

**Geospatial Data and Analysis**
-> Importance of location data (loc_from, loc_to, Assembly).    
-> Technical challenges and opportunities related to location accuracy, geocoding, and routing.
-> Analysis of high-performing zones and implications for service availability.   

**Technical Considerations:** 
-> Use of mapping libraries and APIs.
-> Optimization of location-based queries.
-> Real-time location updates and tracking.

**User Behaviour - Feature Development**
-> Analysis of user interactions (searches, estimates, quotes, OTP).   
-> Insight into user behaviour and potential areas for feature improvement.
-> Emphasis on the impact of quote searches on trip completion.   

**Technical Considerations:** 
-> Implementation of search and quote functionality.
-> User interface/user experience (UI/UX) considerations.
-> Data logging and analytics for user behaviour tracking.

**Handling Cancellations**
-> Review of cancellation rates and their impact on the system.   
-> Technical strategies for reducing cancellations (e.g., real-time updates, communication features).   
-> Importance of cancellation reason tracking.   
**Technical Considerations:** 
-> Implementation of cancellation mechanisms.
-> Notification systems and real-time updates.
-> Data storage and analysis of cancellation reasons.

**System Performance**
-> Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) (e.g., response time, error rates).
-> Strategies for monitoring, testing, and optimizing system performance.
-> Importance of scalability and reliability.
**Technical Considerations:**
-> Load testing and performance profiling.
-> Code optimization and refactoring.
-> Server infrastructure and resource management.

**API Design and Integration**
-> Review of API endpoints and data exchange formats.
-> Security considerations for APIs.
-> Strategies for API versioning and documentation.

**Technical Considerations:** 
-> API design principles (e.g., RESTful APIs).
-> Authentication and authorization.
-> Data serialization and deserialization (e.g., JSON).
