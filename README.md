Case study on Namma Yatri App by Naveen, Sai Laxmi and Mohit.

**Introduction:**
The Namma Yatri app, developed by Bengaluru’s Auto Rickshaw Drivers’ Union (ARDU) and built by Juspay Technologies with support from the Beckn Foundation (founded by Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani), was launched in November 2022 in collaboration with local auto drivers.
It’s Direct-to-Driver open mobility platform.
App has become Bengaluru's most loved auto app, since its formal launch in January 2023.

**Purpose and Goals**
**Project Overview:**
Review of data analysis findings to inform technical development.
Focus on system optimization, feature enhancement, and performance.
Translating insights into actionable development tasks. 

**Key Objective:** Understand user behavior, ride performance, and revenue drivers
**Outcome:** Actionable insights and technical suggestions.

**Data Integration and Structure**
Overview of the data sources and tables (Assembly, Duration, Payment, Trip Details, Trips)
Explanation of the data joins and relationships
Discussion of data types and potential normalization/optimization.

**Handling Peak Hours**
Highlighting peak demand periods (8-10 AM, 5-8 PM).   
Implications for server load, database performance, and scalability.   
Strategies for load balancing, caching, and queue management.

**Revenue-Related Data Points**
Analysis of fare data and its relation to trip duration and time of day.   
Considerations for dynamic pricing algorithms or surge pricing features
Secure and efficient handling of payment data
Technical Considerations
Implementation of fare calculation logic.
Integration with payment gateways.
Data security and compliance (e.g., PCI DSS).

**Geospatial Data and Analysis**
Importance of location data (loc_from, loc_to, Assembly).    
Technical challenges and opportunities related to location accuracy, geocoding, and routing.
Analysis of high-performing zones and implications for service availability.   

**Technical Considerations:** 
Use of mapping libraries and APIs.
Optimization of location-based queries.
Real-time location updates and tracking.

**User Behaviour - Feature Development**
Analysis of user interactions (searches, estimates, quotes, OTP).   
Insights into user behaviour and potential areas for feature improvement.
Emphasis on the impact of quote searches on trip completion.   
Technical Considerations: 
Implementation of search and quote functionality.
User interface/user experience (UI/UX) considerations.
Data logging and analytics for user behaviour tracking.
